    <h2>Hey Stella,</h2>
    <p>
        I don't know where to start from <br> <br>
        Monday 6 November 2023 <br> <br>
        You are all I am thinking about and I just want to take this time having fun with that! <br> <br>
        Well Well WeLL!! To anyone else who is visiting this page I don't know what you are doing <br>But if you are
        interested in other people's lives I will have to say
    </p>
    <p>
        WELCOME!!
    </p>
    <p>
        And this is the girl I am talking about
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        Yes ofcourse! She is the universe! <br>
        Me, you are my universe and I think this world is just good because it has you <br>
        I am not being cringy I mean it!

    <p>
        This song is for you...

    </p>
    <p>
        You don't understand how much you really mean to me <br>
        I can say it everyday but I know you will always think beyond it <br>
        It is always over what you think! <br>
        It is big as the universe!
    </p>
    <p>
        If I had to wish for something and it'd be granted I'd wish to have you for the rest of my days <br>Because even
        if
        I was immotal I wouldn't live to see life without you! <br>And I can't wish to be immotal because that would
        mean to
        live without you <br>I just want you to know that you are the only thing that keeps me hanging on for tommorrow
        <br> When
        I see my life on a bridge I see you too holding me <br>and I can't jump knowing that I'll have to leave you
        alone in
        this cruel life. <br> Me there are no words and there will never be words to explain what you are. <br>I used to
        say that
        you are my spacegirl but that is not even enough you are more than that too. <br>I would sell myself to see you
        smiling <br> gurrrrrrrrrrrrrl you deserve happiness and I wish you knew how I hate to see you sad It kills me
        like <br> I
        would do anything to make you happy for infinity!
    </p>

    <p>
        You were there me!!! In those days <br>
        Days that I wish I could delete on the map <br>
        Days that took me to the lowest <br>
        YOU WERE THERE <br>
        When my days you were with me <br>
        I wish I had proper words to explain this <br>
        But your concern makes me weak and <br>
        I have never been cared about like you do <br>
        GOD KNOWS

    </p>
    <p>Die for you atleast</p>
